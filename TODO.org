* TODO Dynamic creation of Border tables

make-boundary.sh is  a script creating border  tables but it
has default values for spatial partitions.

TODO:  write PLSQL functions  to create  borders dynamically
from a description instead  of having values directly in the
script.

* TODO Cone search with other predicates

When a cone search  is done with other predicates,
the execution engine externalizes queries with the
other predicates  to the pools, but  then the cone
search is slow  because the resulting cache tables
are not indexed.

We could index the cache table with x,y,z index if
needed afrter cache table creation.

* TODO Execution engine more robust

If a thread crashes the whole execution crashes with an
unhandled exception error, and cache tables need to be
cleanup (it could be done manually after a crash with the
cleanup script)

* TODO make-boundary.sh

Take borders as parameters instead of listing them in the script

* TODO Announcement

* TODO Documentation

* TODO Benchmark sur 1 + 4 pools

* TODO Table type management

Table type management needs to be redone 

* TODO Pool Thread Management

Currently a  thread is started for each  external query.  In
order to decrease master and pools load we may have for each
pool a dedicated number of threads.

Pool_1: K threads
Pool_2: K threads
...

And to distribute the  external queries to the corresponding
pool number in a query queue.

This method  would also allow to easily  replicate pools and
to  load balance  between them,  and even  to fallback  to a
replica if one pool crash.

* TODO Use Cube extension when possible

Because of  FDW we  cannot use special  index like
SPGIST  or the  cube extension.   But  as external
queries are  sent directly to  the pool we  may in
that case  use the  cube (or Q3C)  extension.  The
problem is that if it  is not an external query we
cannot use cube nor Q3C.

* TODO Density Estimation function

Astronomers sometimes need to estimate the density:

See also query 025 which is based on a density computation

* TODO Sampling

Provide  an  UDF  for  random  sampling.   Queries
currently use modulo sampling  such as: 
"id % .. = 0"

* TODO Near Neighbors

Search nearest neighbor of a given point




* TODO Write tests for rewriters

This  is   not  trivial   as  we  have   to  check
equivalence  between the  original  query and  the
result.

* TODO Problem with aliases during Join rewriting
* TODO Add a cost model to choose between many distributed execution plans
 
* DONE Random points on the sphere
