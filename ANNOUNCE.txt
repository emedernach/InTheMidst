"ITM: In(to) The Midst"

The aim of this  development project is to produce
an extensible  tool to build  federated databases,
with Scheme as a  scripting language.  It has been
originally  created  as a  research  tool for  the
PETASKY project to  experiment with the processing
of large astronomical databases.

This tool is a database mediator.  Some very large
tables are  partitioned across many  databases and
are presented to the  user as a single table.  ITM
rewrites user query to obtain an execution plan to
be executed on a set of databases.


Features:

- Easily extensible grammar system (used to extend
  SQL with CROSSMATCH operator)

- Query  rewriting  engine  to efficiently  handle
  joins between partitioned tables

- Rewriting rules to handle geometric queries such
  as spatial joins

- The  plan   obtained  could  be   executed  with
  Postgres databases

  
TODO:

- Use  library  (as  Q3C)  to speed  up  geometric
  computation  (but FDW  disallow  use of  foreign
  functions)

- Type system for tables and their columns
